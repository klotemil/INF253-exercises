    <h1>Exercise 06</h1>
    <p>Here is one of my favorite fandoms: Red vs. Blue.</p>
    <p>Red vs. Blue (RvB for short) is an internet series created by a company
      called Rooster Teeth. As of earlier this year, the series completed its
      <strong>17th season.</strong></p><br />This series follows the Reds
      and Blues, two groups of "soldiers" who experience crazy adventures that
      includes things such as AIs, freelancers, aliens, robots, mercenaries,
      fighting, explosions, a lot of swearing, and who knows whatelse.
    <p>The style of this series is called machinima. This style takes something
      that is already pre-rendered (or made) and a storyline is made with it.
      In the case of this series, it is made using the Halo video games, along
      with animation that is put in for certain things like fight scenes.</p>

    <p>Here is a list of the Reds and Blues and somethings about them.</p>
      <h2>The Reds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sarge-Wearing red armor, he's the leader of the Reds. Having a
          Southern accent and carrying a shotgun, he comes up with the strangest
          of plans and often wants to kill Grif.</li>
        <li>Simmons-In maroon armor, he's one of the smarter people out of the
          two groups and a kiss-ass towards Sarge. He's currently a cyborg, has
          trouble talking to girls, and has a fear of snakes.</li>
        <li>Grif-The guy in orange armor, he's a lazy bum and has his life
          threatned by Sarge, <strong>a lot.</strong> He's usually the one that
          drives the Warthog (a short of jeep with a machine gun mounted on it)
          and eats a lot (even stuff that is like 10 years old).</li>
        <li>

    <h1>Exercise 06</h1>
    <p>Here is one of my favorite fandoms: Red vs Blue.</p>
    <p>Red vs Blue (RvB for short) is an internet series created by a company
      called Rooster Teeth. As of earlier this year, the series completed its
      <strong>17th season.</strong></p>
      <p>This series follows the Reds and Blues, two groups of "soldiers" who
        experience crazy adventures that includes things such as AIs,
        freelancers, aliens, robots, mercenaries, fighting, explosions, a lot
        of swearing, and who knows whatelse.</p>
    <blockquote>The style of this series is called machinima. This style takes
      something that is already pre-rendered (or made) and puts a storyline to
      it. In the case of this series, it is made using the Halo video
      games, along with animation that is put in for certain things like fight
      scenes.</blockquote>

    <p>Here is a list of the Reds and Blues and somethings about them.</p>
      <h2>The Reds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sarge-Wearing red armor, he's the leader of the Reds. Having a
          Southern accent and carrying a shotgun, he comes up with the strangest
          of plans and often wants to kill Grif. "How about a tasty lead
          sandwich with a side of Sarge! Hold the life. And the Mayo." -
          Sarge</li>
        <li>Simmons-In maroon armor, he's one of the smarter people out of the
          two groups and a kiss-ass towards Sarge. He's currently a cyborg, has
          trouble talking to girls, and has a fear of snakes. "You're about to
          get Simmonsized!" - Simmons</li>
        <li>Grif-The guy in orange armor, he's a lazy bum and has his life
          threatned by Sarge, <strong>a lot.</strong> He's usually the one that
          drives the Warthog (a sort of jeep with a machine gun mounted on it)
          and eats a lot (even stuff that is like 10 years old). "Protect me,
          Cone!" - Grif</li>
        <li>Donut-Having lightish red (that's what he calls his pink) armor,
          he's the odd one. He likes girly things, appears to be gay, and
          doesn't speak Spanish all that well, but he does throw a grenade
          really good. "Who wants to hold my ankles while I stretch out my
          hammies?" - Donut</li>
        <li>Lopez-He's a robot in with brown armor. The only thing about him is
          that he only speaks Spanish, which means that no one really
          understands what he's saying. "Why do you bother to reply if you
          don't understand what I say?" - Lopez</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The Blues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Church-With cobalt as his armor color, he's the de facto leader of
          Blue Team. Though bad with a sniper rifle, he's a complex character,
          for he is actually an AI and has come back several times, which can
          be a bit complicated to understand without a flowchart. "Holy crap!
          Who is running this army!?" - Church</li>
        <li>Tucker-Aqua as his armor color, he makes a lot of sexual comments.
          Carrying an alien energy sword, he once impregnated by an alien and
          has an alien child named Junior. As of late, he has been more mature
          on certain things. "Bow-chika-bow-wow!" - Tucker</li>
        <li>Caboose-He is the loveable idiot in blue armor. Often times known
          for his team kills (*cough* Church *cough*), he will befriend
          anything, from a talking bomb to an alien AI he names Santa. "Time
          isn't made out of lines! It is made of circles. That is why clocks
          are round." - Caboose</li>
        <li>Doc-Wearing purple armor, he is not truely a part of Blue Team. He
          is actually a pacifist medic. However, he was had an AI in his head
          which now gives him a bit of a split personality from
          time-to-time. "I lettered in track in high school! It was the least
          directly competitive sport I could find!" - Doc</li>
        <li>Sister (AKA Kaikaina Grif)-Wearing yellow armor, she is the one that
          is sometimes hard to understand. She is colorblind, throws raves, and
          can even ejaculate. ("Wait, what?") "What's the grey guy so upset
          about?" - Sister</li>
        <li>Wash-The former Project Freelancer Agent Washington, Wash wears
          black and yellow armor (but was cobalt and yellow at one point). He
          doesn't like having an AI in his head after an accident during his
          Freelancer days, but he becomes the de facto leader of Blue Team when
          Church was no longer leading Blue Team. "Now if you'll excuse me I
          need to go blow up this dead body." - Wash</li>
        <li>Carolina-Former member of Project Freelancer, Carolina wears cyan
          armor. She currently leads Blue Team and is actually the best fighter
          out of both teams. While things from her past have torubled her, she
          has learned to be more of a teammate than a leader. "Call me sweetie
          again, and there's going to be a knife inside of you." - Carolina</li>

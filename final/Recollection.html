          <p>Recollection has each season with a name. Season 6 is Reconstruction.
            The mini-series between seasons 6 and 7 is Relocated. Season 7 is
            Recreation. Season 8 is Revelation.</p>
          <p>This arc takes places some time after the events of at the end of
            The Blood Gulch Chronicles. While this arc could possibly have started
            with the mini-series Recovery One with a Freelancer named Washington
            (Wash for short), is takes things in a new direction for the Reds and
            Blues. This time they have to face an ex-Freelancer who is now called
            The Meta. He is bent on getting the AIs that were a part of Project
            Freelancer in order to get power. However, the Reds and Blues manage
            to stop him with and EMP (though they pronounce it like hemp, but
            without the "h"). Following this, they have to deal the aftermath of
            the Meta and the last surviving AI: Epsilon.</p>

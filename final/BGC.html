          <p>The Blood Gulch Chronicles is the beginning of the Red vs. Blue
            series. We meet the Reds and Blues, the two teams that live opposite
            sides of a box canyon in the middle of nowhere.</p>
          <p>It starts out as something harmless, but then things change when a
            Freelancer shows up. They go on an adventure, meet an alien, believe
            that they went back in time, a medic gets an evil AI in his head,
            a guy has an alien baby, another Freelancer shows up, and they learn
            that there is something more to their canyon than what appears. Also,
            they eventually come to a truce.</p>

          <p>Here is a list of the Reds and Blues and somethings about them.</p>
            <h2>The Reds</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sarge</strong>-Wearing red armor, he's the leader of the
                Reds. Having a Southern accent and carrying a shotgun, he comes up
                with the strangest of plans and often wants to kill Grif. "How about
                a tasty lead sandwich with a side of Sarge! Hold the life. And the
                Mayo." - Sarge</li>
              <li><strong>Simmons</strong>-In maroon armor, he's one of the smarter
                people out of the two groups and a kiss-ass towards Sarge. He's
                currently a cyborg, has trouble talking to girls, and has a fear of
                snakes. "You're about to get Simmonsized!" - Simmons</li>
              <li><strong>Grif</strong>-The guy in orange armor, he's a lazy bum and
                has his life threatned by Sarge, <strong>a lot.</strong> He's usually
                the one that drives the Warthog (a sort of jeep with a machine gun
                mounted on it) and eats a lot (even stuff that is like 10 years old).
                "Protect me, Cone!" - Grif</li>
              <li><strong>Donut</strong>-Having lightish red (that's what he calls
                his pink) armor, he's the "girl" of the group. He likes girly things,
                appears to be gay, and doesn't speak Spanish all that well, but he
                does throw a grenade really good. "Who wants to hold my ankles while
                I stretch out my hammies?" - Donut</li>
              <li><strong>Lopez</strong>-He's a robot with brown armor. The only
                thing about him is that he only speaks Spanish, which means that no
                one really understands what he's saying, and he's pretty much the
                mechanic for the Reds. "Why do you bother to reply if you don't
                understand what I say?" - Lopez</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Blues</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Church</strong>-With cobalt as his armor color, he's the de
                facto leader of Blue Team. Though bad with a sniper rifle, he's a
                complex character, for he is actually an AI and has come back several
                times, which can be a bit complicated to understand him and his story
                without a flowchart. Some other names he might go by are Alpha and
                Epsilon. "Holy crap! Who is running this army!?" - Church</li>
              <li><strong>Tucker</strong>-Aqua as his armor color, he makes a lot of
                sexual comments. Carrying an alien energy sword, he was once
                impregnated by an alien and has an alien child named Junior. As of
                late, he has been more mature on certain things. "Bow-chika-bow-wow!"
                - Tucker</li>
              <li><strong>Caboose</strong>-He is the loveable idiot in blue armor.
                Often times known for his team kills (*cough* Church *cough*), he
                will befriend anything, from a talking bomb to an alien AI he named
                Santa. "Time isn't made out of lines! It is made of circles. That is
                why clocks are round." - Caboose</li>
              <li><strong>Doc</strong>-Wearing purple armor, he is not truely a part
                of Blue Team, though is often associated with them. He is actually a
                pacifist medic. However, he once had an AI in his head which now
                gives him a bit of a split personality from time-to-time, even though
                the AI is gone. "I lettered in track in high school! It was the least
                directly competitive sport I could find!" - Doc</li>
              <li><strong>Sister (AKA Kaikaina Grif)</strong>-Wearing yellow armor,
                she is the one that is sometimes hard to understand. She is
                colorblind, throws a few wild raves, and can even ejaculate. ("Wait,
                what?") "What's the grey guy so upset about?" - Sister</li>
              <li><strong>Tex</strong>-A Freelancer in black armor, she is really
                strong. She has some previous relations with Church, which eventually
                comes to light later on. Also, she is one that would be willing to
                do anything for money. "Payback's a bitch, and so am I." - Tex</li>

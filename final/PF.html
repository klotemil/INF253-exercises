          <p>Seasons 9 and 10 goes back-and-forth between the past and the present.
            In the past, we see the Freelancers when Project Freelancer was still
            operational and its eventual downfall. In the present, we see that another
            Freelancer named Carolina has come and wants the Reds and Blues to help
            her find and kill the Director of Project Freelancer. It is also in
            these teo seasons that really explains any Freelancers that we have
            met and others that we might have heard about.</p>

          <h2>Project Freelancer Members</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The Director - Real name is Dr. Leonard Church and is the
              source of the Alpha AI. He is also the husband of the late Allison
              Church and father to Carolina.</li>
              <li>The Counselor - Adian Price, he is the one who helps the
                Freelancers and knows everything about them.</li>
              <li>Maine - White armor with a secondary color changing. He eventually
                becomes the Meta.</li>
              <li>York - Gold with silver trim, he was paired with Delta. While
                he is good at lock-picking and blind in one eye, he's also in
                love with Carolina.</li>
              <li>Wyoming - With white armor, he was paired with Gamma. He likes
                knock-knock jokes.</li>
              <li>North Dakota and South Dakota (North and South for short) - With
                different shades of purple armor with green trim, they are twins.
                Out of the two, North is the only one to get an AI: Theta.</li>
              <li>CT - Brown armor, she defects from Project Freelancer to join
                the resistance. Texas ends up killing her.</li>
              <li>Wash - The former Project Freelancer Agent
                Washington, Wash wears black and yellow armor (but was cobalt and
                yellow at one point). He doesn't like having an AI in his head after
                an accident during his Freelancer days, but he becomes the de facto
                leader of Blue Team when Church was no longer leading Blue Team. "Now
                if you'll excuse me I need to go blow up this dead body." - Wash</li>
              <li>Carolina-Former member of Project Freelancer,
                Carolina wears cyan armor. She currently leads Blue Team and is
                actually the best fighter out of both teams. While things from her
                past have troubled her, she has learned to be more of a teammate than
                a leader with the Blues. "Call me sweetie again, and there's going to
                be a knife inside of you." - Carolina</li>

          <p>Red vs Blue (RvB for short) is an internet series created by a
            company called Rooster Teeth. As of earlier this year, the series
            completed its <strong>17th season.</strong> This series started in
            2002, which means that it precursed YouTube.</p>
            <p>This series follows the Reds and Blues, two groups of "soldiers"
              who experience crazy adventures that includes things such as AIs,
              freelancers, aliens, robots, mercenaries, fighting, explosions, a
              lot of swearing, and who knows whatelse.</p>
          <blockquote>The style of this series is called machinima. This style
            takes something that is already pre-rendered (or made) and puts a
            storyline to it. In the case of this series, it is made using the
            Halo video games, along with animation that is put in for certain
            things like fight scenes.</blockquote>

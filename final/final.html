          <p>Red vs Blue (RvB for short) is an internet series created by a
            company called Rooster Teeth. As of earlier this year, the series
            completed its <strong>17th season.</strong> This series started in
            2002, which means that it precursed YouTube.</p>
          <p>This series follows the Reds and Blues, two groups of "soldiers"
            who experience crazy adventures that includes things such as AIs,
            freelancers, aliens, robots, mercenaries, fighting, explosions, a
            lot of swearing, and who knows whatelse.</p>
          <blockquote>The style of this series is called machinima. This style
            takes something that is already pre-rendered (or made) and puts a
            storyline to it. In the case of this series, it is made using the
            Halo video games, along with animation that is put in for certain
            things like fight scenes.</blockquote>
          <p>Throughout the series, there has been a number of "arcs" that has
            occurred. Each arc contains a number of seasons of the series that
            make up a ertain part of the RvB universe. Seasons 1-5 makes up the
            Blood Gulch Chronicles. Seasons 6-8 and the mini-series Relocated
            make up The Recollection. Seasons 9 and 10 make up Project Freelancer.
            Finally, seasons 11-13 make up The Chorus Trilogy. While there are
            also season 14-17 to consider, season 14 was an anthology (series of
            mini stories throughout the RvB universe) and 15-17 are still a
            continuing arc. Overall, seasons 1-13 can best be described in what
            occurs in them.</p>
